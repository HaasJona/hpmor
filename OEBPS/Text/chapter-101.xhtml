  <div class="calibre1">
    <p>The Defence Professor had set up a cauldron, floating it into place with a wave of his wand, another wave starting a fire beneath it. A brief circling of the Defence Professor’s finger had set in motion a long-handled spoon, and it had continued stirring the cauldron without being held. Now the Defence Professor was measuring out a heap of flowers from a large jar, what Harry supposed to be bellflowers; the indigo petals seemed luminous in the white light of the walls, and curved inward in a way that gave the impression of a desire for privacy. The first of these flowers had been added to the potion at once, but then the cauldron had just gone on stirring itself for a while.</p>

    <p>The Defence Professor had assumed a position from which he could see Harry just by turning his head slightly, and Harry knew that he was within the Defence Professor’s peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>In the corner a Fiendfyre phoenix waited, some of the nearby stone beginning to gloss over as it melted to greater smoothness. The burning wings shed crimson light that gave everything in the room a tint of blood, and reflected in scarlet sparks from the glassware.</p>

    <p>‘Time is wasting,’ said Professor Quirrell. ‘Ask your questions, if you have them.’</p>

    <p><i>Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why make yourself the monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not want the same things I do, but I can’t imagine what you want that makes</i> this <i>the best way to get it …</i></p>

    <p>That was what Harry’s brain wanted to know.</p>

    <p>What Harry <em>needed</em> to know was … some way out of what was going to happen next. But the Defence Professor had said that he wouldn’t talk about his future plans. It was strange enough that the Defence Professor was willing to talk about <em>anything,</em> that had to contradict one of his Rules …</p>

    <p>‘I’m thinking,’ Harry said aloud.</p>

    <p>Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. He was using a pestle to grind the potion’s first magical ingredient, a glowing red hexagon. ‘I <em>quite</em> understand,’ said the Defence Professor. ‘But do not think over-long, child.’</p>

    <p class="thought">Goals: Prevent Lord Voldemort from harming people, find a way to kill or neutralise him, but first get the Stone and resurrect Hermione …</p>

    <p class="thought">… convince Professor Quirrell to <i>stop this …</i></p>

    <p>Harry swallowed, pushing down the emotion, trying not to let the water reach his eyes. Tears probably wouldn’t make a good impression on Lord Voldemort. Professor Quirrell was already frowning, though from the direction of his gaze he was examining a leaf coloured in vivid shades of white, green, and purple.</p>

    <p>There wasn’t any obvious way to reach any of the goals, not yet. All Harry could do was ask the questions that seemed most likely to provide useful information, even if Harry didn’t yet have a plan.</p>

    <p><i>So we just ask about whatever seems most interesting?</i> said Harry’s Ravenclaw side. <i>I’m up for that.</i></p>

    <p><i>Shut up,</i> Harry told the voice; and then, on further reflection, decided that he was no longer pretending it was there.</p>

    <p>Four topics came to Harry’s mind as being priorities from the standpoint of curiosity about important things. Four questions, then, four major subjects, to try to fit in while this potion was still being brewed.</p>

    <p>Four questions …</p>

    <p>‘I ask my first question,’ Harry said. ‘What really happened on the night of October 31st, 1981?’ <i>Why was that night different from all other nights …</i> ‘I would like the entire story, please.’</p>

    <p>The question of how and why Lord Voldemort had survived his apparent death seemed likely to matter for future planning.</p>

    <p>‘I expected you would ask that,’ Professor Quirrell said, dropping a bellflower and a white glittering stone into the potion. ‘To begin, everything I told you about the horcrux spell is true; as you should realise, since I spoke in Parseltongue.’</p>

    <p>Harry nodded.</p>

    <p>‘Within seconds after you learned the details of the spell, you perceived the central flaw, and began pondering how the spell might be improved. Do you think the young Tom Riddle was any different?’</p>

    <p>Harry shook his head.</p>

    <p>‘Well, he was,’ said Professor Quirrell. ‘Whenever I was tempted to despair of you, I reminded myself how I was an idiot at twice your age. When I was fifteen I made myself a horcrux as a certain book had shown me, using the death of Abigail Myrtle beneath the eyes of Slytherin’s basilisk. I planned to make a new horcrux every year after I left Hogwarts, and call that my fallback plan if my other hopes of immortality did not come to fruition. In retrospect, the young Tom Riddle was grasping straws. The thought of making a <em>better</em> horcrux, of not being content with the spell I had already learned … this thought did not come to me until I had grasped the stupidity of ordinary people, and realised which follies of theirs I had imitated. But in time I learned the habit that you inherited from me, to ask in every instance how it might be done better. To be content with the spell I had learned from a book, when it bore only a faint resemblance to what I truly wanted? Absurd! And so I set forth to create a better spell.’</p>

    <p>‘You have true immortality, now?’ Harry was aware that, even with everything else going on, this was a question more important than war and strategy.</p>

    <p>‘Indeed,’ said Professor Quirrell. He paused in his Potions work and turned to face Harry fully; there was a look of exultation in the man’s eyes that Harry had never seen there before. ‘In all the Darkest Arts I could find, in all the interdicted secrets to which Slytherin’s Monster gave me keys, in all the lore remembered among wizardkind, I found only hints and smatterings of what I needed. So I rewove it and remade it, and devised a new ritual based on new principles. I kept that ritual burning in my mind for years, perfecting it in imagination, pondering its meaning and making fine adjustments, waiting for the intention to stabilise. At last I dared to invoke my ritual, an invented sacrificial ritual, based on a principle untested by all known magic. And I lived, and yet live.’ The Defence Professor spoke with quiet triumph, as though the act itself was so great that no words could ever do it justice. ‘I still use the word “horcrux”, but only from sentiment. It is a new thing entirely, the greatest of all my creations.’</p>

    <p>‘As one of my questions you said you’d answer, I ask how to cast that spell,’ Harry said.</p>

    <p>‘Denied.’ The Defence Professor turned back to his potion, dropping in a grey-flecked white feather and a bellflower. ‘I had thought perhaps to teach you when you were older, for no Tom Riddle would be content otherwise; but I have changed my mind.’</p>

    <p>Memory is a hard thing to recall, sometimes, and Harry had been trying to remember if Professor Quirrell had dropped any hints about this subject before. Something about Professor Quirrell’s phrasing sparked a memory: <i>Perhaps you will be told when you are older …</i></p>

    <p>‘There are still physical anchors for your immortality,’ Harry said aloud. ‘It resembles the old horcrux spell by that much, which is another reason you still call them horcruxes.’ It was dangerous to say aloud, but Harry needed to <em>know.</em> ‘If I’m wrong, you can always deny it in Parseltongue.’</p>

    <p>Professor Quirrell was smiling evilly. <i class="parsel">‘Your gue<span class="ps">ss</span> i<span class="ps">s</span> right, boy, for all the good it doe<span class="ps">s</span> you.’</i></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t a difficult vulnerability to cover if the Enemy was smart. Harry wouldn’t ordinarily have made the suggestion, just in case the Enemy <em>hadn’t</em> thought of it for themselves, but in this case he’d already made it. ‘One horcrux dropped into an active volcano, weighted so it would sink into the Earth’s mantle,’ Harry said heavily. ‘The same place I thought of dropping the Dementor if I couldn’t destroy it. And then you asked me where else I would hide something if I didn’t want anyone to find it ever again. One horcrux buried kilometres down, in an anonymous cubic metre of the Earth’s crust. One horcrux you dropped into the Mariana Trench. One horcrux floating high in the stratosphere, transparent. Even you don’t know where they are, because you Obliviated the exact details from your memory. And the last horcrux is the Pioneer 11 plaque that you sneaked into NASA and modified. It’s where you get your image of the stars, when you cast the spell of starlight. Fire, earth, water, air, void.’ <i>Something of a riddle,</i> the Defence Professor had called it, and therefore Harry had remembered it. Something of a Riddle.</p>

    <p>‘Indeed,’ said the Defence Professor. ‘It did give me something of a shock when you remembered it that quickly, but I suppose it makes no difference; all five are beyond my reach, or yours.’</p>

    <p>That might not be true, especially if there was some way to trace the magical connection somehow and determine the location … though presumably Voldemort would have done his best to obscure it … but what magic had done, magic might be able to defeat. Pioneer 11 might be far away by wizard standards, but NASA knew exactly where it was, and it was probably a lot more reachable if you could use magic to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to bugger off …</p>

    <p>A sudden note of worry plucked at Harry’s mind. There was no rule saying the Defence Professor needed to have told the truth about <em>which</em> interstellar probe he’d horcruxed, and if Harry recalled correctly, communication and tracking of the Pioneer 10 probe had been lost shortly after the Jupiter fly-by.</p>

    <p>Why wouldn’t Professor Quirrell have just horcruxed them both?</p>

    <p>The obvious next thought came to Harry. It was something that ought not to be suggested, if the Enemy had not thought of it. But it seemed extremely probable that the Enemy had thought of it.</p>

    <p><i class="parsel">‘Tell me, teacher,’</i> Harry hissed, <i class="parsel">‘would de<span class="ps">s</span>troying tho<span class="ps">s</span>e five anchors <span class="ps">s</span>lay you?’</i></p>

    <p><i class="parsel">‘Why do you a<span class="ps">s</span>k?’</i> hissed the Defence Professor, with a lilt to the hiss that Parseltongue translated as snakish amusement. <i class="parsel">‘Do you <span class="ps">s</span>u<span class="ps">s</span>pect that an<span class="ps">s</span>wer is no?’</i></p>

    <p>Harry couldn’t think of how to answer, though he strongly suspected that it didn’t matter in any case.</p>

    <p><i class="parsel">‘Your <span class="ps">s</span>u<span class="ps">s</span>picion i<span class="ps">s</span> right, boy. De<span class="ps">s</span>troying tho<span class="ps">s</span>e five would not render me mortal.’</i></p>

    <p>Harry’s throat felt a bit dry again. If the spell had no disastrous cost associated with it … <i class="parsel">‘How many anchor<span class="ps">s</span> did you make?’</i></p>

    <p><i class="parsel">‘Would not ordinarily <span class="ps">s</span>ay, but i<span class="ps">s</span> clear you have already gue<span class="ps">ss</span>ed.’</i> The Defence Professor’s smile widened. <i class="parsel">‘An<span class="ps">s</span>wer i<span class="ps">s</span> that I do not know. <span class="ps">S</span>topped counting <span class="ps">s</span>omewhere around one hundred and <span class="ps">s</span>even. <span class="ps">S</span>imply made a habit of it each time I murdered <span class="ps">s</span>omeone in private.’</i></p>

    <p>Over <i>one hundred</i> murders, in private, before Lord Voldemort had stopped counting. And even worse news – ‘Your immortality spell still requires a human death? <em>Why?</em>’</p>

    <p><i class="parsel">‘Great creation maintain<span class="ps">s</span> life and magic within device<span class="ps">s</span> created by <span class="ps">s</span>acrificing life and magic of other<span class="ps">s</span>.’</i> Again that hissing snake laughter. <i class="parsel">‘Liked fal<span class="ps">s</span>e de<span class="ps">s</span>cription of previou<span class="ps">ss</span> horcrux <span class="ps">s</span>pell <span class="ps">s</span>o much, <span class="ps">s</span>o di<span class="ps">s</span>appointed when reali<span class="ps">s</span>ed truth of it, thought<span class="ps">s</span> of improved ver<span class="ps">s</span>ion came out in that <span class="ps">s</span>hape.’</i></p>

    <p>Harry wasn’t sure why the Defence Professor was giving him all this vital information, <i>but there had to be a reason,</i> and that was making him nervous. ‘So you really are a disembodied spirit possessing Quirinus Quirrell.’</p>

    <p>‘<i class="parsel">Yess. I sshall return sswiftly, if thiss body iss killed. Will be greatly annoyed, and vengeful.</i> I am telling you this, boy, so that you do not try anything stupid.’</p>

    <p>‘I understand,’ Harry said. He did his best to organize his thoughts, remember what he’d meant to ask next, while the Defence Professor turned his eyes back to the potion. The man’s left hand was dribbling crushed seashell into the cauldron, while his right hand dropped in another bellflower. ‘So what did happen on October 31st? You … tried to turn the baby Harry Potter into a horcrux, either the new kind or the old kind. You did it deliberately, because you told Lily Potter,’ Harry took a breath. Now that he knew <em>why</em> the chills were there, he could endure them. ‘Very well, I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.’ In retrospect, it was clear that Harry had remembered that event mainly from Lord Voldemort’s perspective, and only at the very end had he seen it through the baby Harry Potter’s eyes. ‘What did you do? <em>Why</em> did you do it?’</p>

    <p>‘Trelawney’s prophecy,’ Professor Quirrell said. His hand tapped a bellflower with a strip of copper before dropping it in. ‘I spent long days pondering it, after Snape brought the prophecy to me. Prophecies are never trivial things. And how shall I put this in a way that does not make you think stupid things … well, I shall say it, and if you are stupid I shall be annoyed. I was fascinated by the prophecy’s assertion that someone would be my equal, because it might mean that person could hold up the other end of an intelligent conversation. After fifty years of being surrounded by gibbering stupidity, I no longer cared whether my reaction might be considered a literary cliche. I was not about to pass up on that opportunity without thinking about it first. And then, you see, I had a <i>clever idea</i>.’ Professor Quirrell sighed. ‘It occurred to me how I might fulfil the Prophecy my own way, to my own benefit. I would mark the baby as my equal by casting the old horcrux spell in such fashion as to imprint my own spirit onto the baby’s blank slate; it would be a purer copy of myself, since there would be no old self to mix with the new. In some years, when I had become bored with ruling Britain and moved on to other things, I would arrange with the other Tom Riddle that he should appear to vanquish me, and he would rule over the Britain he had saved. We would play the game against each other forever, keeping our lives interesting amid a world of fools. I knew a dramatist would predict that the two of us would end by destroying each other; but I pondered long upon it, and decided that both of us would simply decline to play out the drama. That was my decision and I was confident that it would remain so; both Tom Riddles, I thought, would be too intelligent to truly go down that road. The prophecy seemed to hint that if I destroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter, then our spirits would not be so different, and we could exist in the same world.’</p>

    <p>‘Something went wrong,’ Harry said. ‘Something that blew off the top of the Potters’ home in Godric’s Hollow, gave me the scar on my forehead, and left your burnt body behind.’</p>

    <p>Professor Quirrell nodded. His hands had slowed in their Potions work. ‘The resonance in our magic,’ Professor Quirrell said quietly. ‘When I had shaped the baby’s spirit to be like my own …’</p>

    <p>Harry remembered the moment in Azkaban when Professor Quirrell’s Killing Curse had collided with his Patronus. The burning, tearing agony in his forehead, like his head had been about to split in half.</p>

    <p>‘I cannot count how many times I have thought of that night, rehearsing my mistake, thinking of wiser things I should have done,’ said Professor Quirrell. ‘I later decided that I should have thrown my wand from my hand and changed into my Animagus form. But that night … that night, I instinctively tried to control the chaotic fluctuations in my magic, even as I felt myself burning up from inside. That was the wrong decision, and I failed. So my body was destroyed, even as I overwrote the infant Harry Potter’s mind; <em>each</em> of us destroying all but a remnant of the other. And then …’ Professor Quirrell’s expression was controlled. ‘And then, when I regained consciousness inside my horcruxes, it turned out that my great creation did not work as I had hoped. I should have been able to float free of my horcruxes and possess any victim that consented to me, or that was too weak to refuse me. <em>That</em> was the part of my great creation that failed my intent. As with the original horcrux spell, I would only be able to enter a victim who contacted the physical horcrux … and I had hidden my unnumbered horcruxes in places where nobody would ever find them. Your instinct is correct, boy, <i>this would not be a good time to laugh.</i>’</p>
